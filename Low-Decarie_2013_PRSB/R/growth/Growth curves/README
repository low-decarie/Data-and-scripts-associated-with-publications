      example data
   exponential_growth_nls.R
      exponetial growth using non linear least squares (nls)
   logistic_growth_nls.R
      logistic growth using nls
   logistic_growth_mle.R
      logistic growth using maximum likelihood estimation (mle)
      currently only works with normal error distribution
      needs to be implemented using either logitnormal distribution or normal distribution of the logit
      both cases use the ratio of Nt over a maximum value slightly higher than K
